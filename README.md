## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use it to create a responsive grid layout. I am definitely gonna use it again in the future.

```css
.first-feature-section {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}

.first-feature-intro {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
  width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 4rem;
}
```
### Continued development

I will continue to learn more about CSS Grid and how it can be used to create a more complex layout.
